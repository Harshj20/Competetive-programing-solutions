You are given 2-3 trees T1 and T2, representing respectively finite sets S1, S2
of natural numbers. Further, it is given that for all x ∈ S1 and for all y ∈ S2, x < y.
Write a program to form a new 2-3 tree representing S1 U S2 with time compexity of O(H(T1) + H(T2)), 
where H(T) represents height of tree T.
